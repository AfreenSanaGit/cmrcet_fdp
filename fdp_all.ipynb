            "The difference between CNN and YOLO lies in their framework and approach to object detection. While both are based on convolutional neural networks, YOLO processes the entire image at once, dividing it into regions and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly. In contrast, CNN-based approaches like R-CNN first generate region proposals and then classify and refine them. Additionally, YOLO uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities, whereas CNN-based approaches often use multiple stages and separate networks for these tasks.\n"
